##Insult Them (@insult_them)
Insult them is a handy twitter helper bot that will do the honors when you want to insult someone else.

Just mention the users to be insulted to @insult_them and the service will be rendered.

This uses the "twitter" gem.

You can customize the insults by updating the responses.yml file and you can use your own twitter account by changing the oauth_keys.yml file.
